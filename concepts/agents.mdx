An **Agent** is a configurable AI worker that you can create and deploy to perform specific tasks autonomously. Think of it as a specialized team member you can design, train, and assign to a job. Each agent operates based on a set of instructions and can be equipped with various tools to achieve its objectives.

Agents are the core of the Ag.dev platform. They are designed to be "headless," meaning they execute tasks in the background without requiring a real-time conversational interface. You define their purpose, and they work independently to deliver results.

### The Anatomy of an Agent

An agent is defined by several key properties that control its behavior and capabilities:

-   **Goal Prompt**: This is the most important instruction, defining the agent's primary objective. A clear, specific goal is crucial for success.
-   **Tools**: An agent can be equipped with a set of [Tools](/concepts/tools) to perform actions like searching the web, browsing websites, or interacting with external services via MCP.
-   **Input Schema**: This is a JSON schema that defines the structure of the data an agent expects to receive for a run. [Learn more about Inputs](/concepts/inputs).
-   **Output Configuration**: You can configure an agent to return its result as a freeform `document` or as a structured `json` object that conforms to a specific schema.
-   **Model Stack**: You can select the underlying AI model that the agent will use, allowing you to choose the best fit for your task's complexity and cost.
-   **Status**: An agent can be `active` or `inactive`. An inactive agent cannot be run.

### The Agent Lifecycle

1.  **Creation**: You create an agent through the Ag.dev Console or API, defining its anatomy.
2.  **Execution**: Once created, the agent is ready to be run. Each execution is called a [Run](/concepts/runs).
3.  **Monitoring & Refinement**: You can monitor the performance of an agent by observing its runs. Based on the results, you can refine its goal, tools, or other settings to improve its effectiveness.

By creating and combining different agents, you can build powerful, automated workflows to handle complex tasks at scale.
