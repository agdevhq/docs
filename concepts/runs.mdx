A **Run** is a single execution of an [Agent](/concepts/agents). When you assign a task to an agent by providing it with specific inputs, you initiate a run. The run represents the entire lifecycle of that task, from starting the process to delivering the final result.

Each run is a distinct, logged instance of an agent's work, allowing you to track and analyze its performance on a case-by-case basis. Runs are tied to a specific [agent revision](/concepts/versioning), ensuring consistent and reproducible execution.

### The Anatomy of a Run

-   **Input**: Every run begins with an `input`, which is a JSON object that conforms to the agent's defined `inputSchema`. This input provides the specific data and parameters the agent needs to complete its task. For example, if you have a research agent, the input might be `{"topic": "AI in healthcare"}`. [Learn more about how to define and use Inputs](/concepts/inputs).
-   **Agent Revision**: Each run executes against a specific agent revision. By default, runs use the published revision, but you can specify any revision ID to test draft changes or reproduce historical results.
-   **Status**: A run progresses through several statuses:
    -   `pending`: The run has been created but has not yet started.
    -   `running`: The agent is actively working on the task.
    -   `done`: The agent has successfully completed the task.
    -   `error`: The run failed due to an error.
-   **Events**: During a run, the agent emits a series of `events` that provide a real-time log of its thought process and actions. These events include `planning`, `reasoning`, and `tool_call`, giving you full visibility into how the agent is working towards its goal.
-   **Result**: Once a run is complete, it produces a `resultData`. This can be a text `document` or a structured `json` object, depending on the agent's configuration. If the agent used research tools, the result will also include a list of sources it consulted.

### Why are Runs Important?

Runs are essential for several reasons:

-   **Traceability**: They provide a complete audit trail of an agent's activity. You can see exactly what an agent did, what tools it used, and how it arrived at its conclusions.
-   **Debugging**: When a run fails or produces unexpected results, the detailed event log is invaluable for debugging. You can pinpoint the exact step where things went wrong.
-   **Performance Monitoring**: By analyzing multiple runs, you can evaluate an agent's consistency and accuracy over time, helping you identify opportunities for improvement.
-   **Scalability**: An agent can be run many times in parallel with different inputs, allowing you to automate tasks at a massive scale. Each run is an independent process.

### Creating Runs with Specific Revisions

When creating a run, you have two options for revision selection:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Published (Default)">
    By default, runs use the agent's published revision:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.ag.dev/v0.1/agents/{agentId}/runs \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -d '{"input": {"topic": "AI in healthcare"}}'
    ```

    <Warning>
    If no revision has been published, the run will fail with an error. Make sure to publish at least one revision before creating production runs.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Specific Revision">
    You can target any revision (published or draft) by providing its ID:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.ag.dev/v0.1/agents/{agentId}/runs \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -d '{
        "revisionId": "{revisionId}",
        "input": {"topic": "AI in healthcare"}
      }'
    ```

    This is useful for:
    - Testing draft revisions before publishing
    - Reproducing historical results
    - A/B testing different configurations
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You can create and monitor runs through the Console or programmatically via the API. Each run maintains a permanent link to the specific revision it executed, ensuring full traceability.
