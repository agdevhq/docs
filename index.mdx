Ag.dev is a powerful platform designed for building, testing, and scaling autonomous AI agents. With Ag.dev, you can automate complex tasks by creating "headless" agents that operate without direct human interaction. Unlike traditional AI chatbots that you converse with in a chat interface, these agents are designed to run in the background, executing tasks and delivering results independently.

### Key Features:

-   **Natural Language Agent Configuration**: Define an agent's purpose, behavior, and tools using simple instructions, without writing a single line of code.
-   **Structured Inputs and Outputs**: Agents accept structured data as input and can be configured to return results in JSON format or as a text document.
-   **Extensible Tooling**: Equip your agents with a variety of tools, including web search, news retrieval, and website browsing. Extend your agent's capabilities with your own external tools and services through MCP.
-   **Scalable by Design**: Build your agent once and run it in parallel with different inputs for powerful batch processing. Once an agent is configured, you can execute it at scale through a simple API, enabling millions of runs to automate your workflows.
-   **Seamless Workflow Integration**: Trigger agents from your existing processes and workflows via API calls or webhooks. Automate tasks like researching a new sales lead when they sign up, generating a report when a new dataset is available, or sending personalized onboarding emails to new users as soon as they register.
-   **Detailed Monitoring**: Get full visibility into each agent's execution, with detailed logs and traces that make it easy to debug and refine performance.

## What are Headless Agents?

A "headless" agent is an AI that performs tasks autonomously, without requiring a conversational interface. Think of it as a worker you can hire, train, and deploy to handle specific jobs. You provide the instructions and the necessary tools, and the agent gets to work, reporting back only when the job is done. For example, an agent could be tasked with conducting in-depth research, monitoring a website for changes, or generating a personalized report.

### How are Headless Agents Different?

The primary difference between headless agents and traditional AI assistants lies in their mode of operation:

-   **Chat-based Agents**: These are designed for real-time interaction. You engage in a dialogue, ask questions, and receive immediate responses. They are excellent for tasks that require a back-and-forth conversation, such as customer support or creative brainstorming.
-   **Headless Agents**: These are optimized for automation. You define a task, and the agent executes it from start to finish without further input. They are ideal for processes that can be clearly defined and repeatedâ€”such as custom deep research, data extraction and enrichment, content generation, or monitoring.
